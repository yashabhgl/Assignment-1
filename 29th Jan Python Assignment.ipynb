    "\n",
    "Imperative Programming: Python supports imperative programming, which is a style of programming that focuses on giving the computer a sequence of tasks to perform. Imperative programming is based on the idea of making changes to a program's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python is an object-oriented programming language. OOP is a programming paradigm that focuses on using objects and classes to design applications and computer programs. It is based on the concept of objects, which have data and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming: Python also supports functional programming, which is a style of programming that emphasizes the use of functions to build programs. In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, meaning that they can be used as arguments or return values just like any other data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural Programming: Python also supports procedural programming, which is a style of programming that focuses on breaking down a program into procedures or subroutines. Procedures are similar to functions and can be used to encapsulate a specific task or set of tasks."

    "\n",
    "Ans. Yes, Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers. This means that the names you give to variables, functions, classes, and other elements of your code must be spelled exactly the same way each time you use them. For example, if you have a variable named \"myVariable,\" you cannot refer to it as \"myvariable\" or \"MyVariable.\" The names must match exactly, including the case of each letter."

This means that the Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line, rather than compiling it into machine code and executing that machine code. This approach has several advantages, including the ability to run the code on a variety of platforms without the need for recompilation and the ease of debugging and testing code."

It automatically manages the allocation of memory for objects and data structures, as well as freeing memory that is no longer in use. This helps to simplify the task of writing memory-efficient applications and reduces the risk of memory leaks. The memory manager in Python is based on a dynamic system, which means that the amount of memory used by an application can increase or decrease dynamically during execution based on the needs of the program."
